### The objective of our project
(1) Investigate the effectiveness of using a pre-trained model in a different language to perform a task in English: Especially, we will examine whether a Korean Language pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to summarize English reviews effectively.
(2) Investigate the use of generative models that do noe require fine-tuning: We will explore the use of generative models that do not require fine-tuning to summarize reviews. We will compare the performance of these models with the fine-tuned Korean Language model and assess their effectiveness.
